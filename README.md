I watched The Martian the other day and really liked the hexadecimal scene! Matt Damon’s character, Mark Watney, faced a problem in which his only way of communicating with NASA was using a 360° spinning camera. 

He first rules out the English alphabet because twenty-six letter cards plus one question mark card would be too narrow to tell what the camera was pointing at; it would only give 13° of arc. Then he had the realization of hexadecimals, “hexadecimals to the rescue.”

With ASCII tables, one of the main ways to represent values is hexadecimal (base 16), using digits 0-9 with letters A-F. 

“H” = 48 (hex) 
“O” = 4F (hex) 
“W” = 57 (hex) 

With sixteen cards plus one question mark card, the spacing increased to 21° of arc. This gave him enough card separation to successfully communicate with NASA using hexadecimals!

TL;DR: If your only means of communication is a 360° spinning camera… hexadecimals will save you!

Side note: ASCII value “?” = “3F” so why did the movie add a card for it? Idk man :/
